# Example Images for README

This directory should contain demonstration images showing the Image2MC pipeline in action.

## Required Images

### Main Pipeline Demonstration (3-image sequence)
- **`input_photos.jpg`**: Collage or grid showing multiple input photos of the same scene/building
- **`pointcloud_view.png`**: 3D visualization of the generated point cloud 
- **`minecraft_build.png`**: Screenshot of the final Minecraft build

### Detailed Step-by-Step Pipeline (6 images)
- **`input_video.gif`**: Short animated GIF showing video input (walkthrough of scene)
- **`sampled_frames.jpg`**: Grid of key frames extracted from the video
- **`sfm_reconstruction.png`**: Visualization showing camera poses and sparse 3D points from SfM
- **`dense_pointcloud.png`**: Dense, colored 3D point cloud visualization
- **`voxel_grid.png`**: Voxelized representation (cubic grid overlay)
- **`final_build.png`**: Final Minecraft build screenshot (different angle than main demo)

## Image Specifications

- **Resolution**: Aim for at least 800x600 for clear viewing
- **Format**: PNG for screenshots, JPG for photos, GIF for animations
- **Style**: Consistent lighting and color grading across the sequence
- **Content**: Same scene/building throughout to show clear progression

## Tips for Great Demo Images

1. **Choose a recognizable subject**: Buildings, landmarks, or distinctive objects work best
2. **Show clear progression**: Each step should visually build upon the previous
3. **Highlight key features**: Make sure important details are visible in each stage
4. **Use consistent viewpoints**: Keep similar camera angles where possible to show transformation
5. **Quality matters**: High-quality, well-lit photos will make the entire demo more impressive
